Algebraic Visualization Design is a theory [Gordon Kindlmann](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/) and [Carlos
Scheidegger](http://cscheid.net) have created to help understand how and why some
visualizations work better than others.

### Why [by-nd](http://creativecommons.org/choose/results-one?license_code=by-nd)?

We would love for all of you to write about algebraic visualization
design, but we would prefer that you did it in your own words. That
is, we obssess more than is healthy about how to write the content
that is actually here. We would like to spend that neurotic energy
on this website, and not wondering if some change in a derivative work
might have made it harder for us to explain things here. That's all.
